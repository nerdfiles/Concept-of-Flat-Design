An application of Gilbert Ryle's Category Theory (the Category Mistake) as it applies to modern design 
(graphic, web, industrial, type, etc.).

##Adaptation of git-flow

The following convention is a first shot at analogizing or mapping the git-flow branching strategy 
for writing and publication of digital books.

		master   <->  publication
		develop  <->  draft
		feature  <->  chapter
		release  <->  edition
		hotfix   <->  redact
		support  <->  copyright

See http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ for more information on these relationships 
and a practical guide on ``git-flow``.
